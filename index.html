                   "The Shire is an ideal vacation spot for those who want to get away from it all. Almost completely isolated from the turmoil of Middle Earth, it's the perfect getaway spot, located in a picturesque countryside."

                    "The capital and largest city in the kingdom of Gondor, Minas Tirith, while not as prosperous as it was during the Third Age, still provides all of the amenities of a metropolitan capital.  Majestic mountain views combine with fine dining and a thrivimg pub scene will keep any visitor entertained."
