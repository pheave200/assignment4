                   "The Shire is an ideal vacation spot for those who want to get away from it all. Almost completely isolated from the turmoil of Middle Earth, it's the perfect getaway spot, located in a picturesque countryside."

                <p>
                    "The peaceful town of Rivendell is nestled at the edge of a narrow gorge of the river Bruinen.  The seat of the house of Elrond provides sweeping riverview vistas with the lush backdrop of the Misty Mountains"

                    "The capital and largest city in the kingdom of Gondor, Minas Tirith, while not as prosperous as it was during the Third Age, still provides all of the amenities of a metropolitan capital.  Majestic mountain views combine with fine dining and a thrivimg pub scene will keep any visitor entertained."
